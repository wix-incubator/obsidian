> Dependency injection framework for React and React Native applications

## Introduction
Applications are made of objects that communicate with each other. An object can depend on other objects so it can perform its responsibilities. For an object to function properly, its dependencies must be fulfilled when the object is constructed.

React Obsidian is a dependency injection framework for React and React Native applications. It allows you to inject dependencies effortlessly into hooks, components or classes. Separating the construction and consumption of dependencies is crucial to maintaining a readable and testable codebase.

React Obsidian is guided by the principles of the Dependency Injection pattern, but does not strictly follow it. We allowed ourselves a degree of freedom when designing the library in order to reduce boilerplate code and reduce library footprint.

## Installation

``` shell
npm install react-obsidian
```

See the #Prerequisites section for additional requirements.

## Usage

### Declare an object graph
Before we can inject dependencies into hooks, components and classes, we first need to declare our dependencies. Dependencies are declared in classes called "Graphs" where the relationships between the dependencies are outlined.

In the `ApplicationGraph` example below, we declare two dependencies:
1. `httpClient`
2. `biLogger`

Both functions are annotated by the `@Provides()` annotation. This signals Obsidian that the results of these functions are provided by the graph and can be injected.

Notice how the biLogger function receives an `httpClient` as an argument. This means that `biLogger` has a dependency on `httpClient`. Obsidian will create an `httpClient` when `biLogger` is injected. 

``` typescript
@Singleton() @Graph()
export default class ApplicationGraph extends ObjectGraph {
  @Provides()
  httpClient(): HttpClient {
    return new HttpClient();
  }

  @Provides()
  biLogger(httpClient: HttpClient): BiLogger {
    return new BiLogger(httpClient);
  }
}
```

### Component injection
```typescript
import {injectComponent} from 'react-obsidian';

interface InjectedComponentProps {
  biLogger: BiLogger;
}

// When injecting components - we must use destructuring in order for Obsidian to know which dependencies to inject.
const InjectedComponent = ({ biLogger }: InjectedComponentProps) => (
  <>
    <button onclick={biLogger.logButtonClick}>Click Me</button>
  </>
);

export default injectComponent(InjectedComponent, ApplicationGraph);
```

### Hooks injection

```typescript
interface UseButtonPressProps {
  biLogger: BiLogger;
}

interface UseButtonPress {
  usePress: () => void;
}

// Similarly to how dependencies are injected into hooks, we must use destructuring for Obsidian to be able to inject the dependencies.
const useButtonClick = ({ biLogger }: UseButtonPressProps): UseButtonPress => {
  const onClick = useCallback(() => {
    biLogger.logButtonClick();
  }, [biLogger]);
  
  return { onClick };
};

// Dependencies are injected from ApplicationGraph
export default injectHook(usePress, ApplicationGraph);

// Now that exported the injected hook, we can use it in a component without needed so provide it's dependencies manually
const Component = () => (
  // No need to specify dependencies as they are injected automatically
  const { onClick } = useButtonClick();
  <>
    <button onclick={onClick}>Click Me</button>
  </>
);
```

### Class injection
Obsidian supports injected class properties. Constructor injection is not supported at this time.

```typescript
@Injectable(ApplicationGraph)
class ButtonController {
  @Inject biLogger!: BiLogger;

  onClick() {
    this.biLogger.logButtonClick();
  }
}
```

### Obtaining dependencies from a graph
Dependencies can also be obtained by accessing the graph that provides them.

```typescript
Obsidian.obtain(ApplicationGraph).biLogger();
```

> Note: While the function that provides the `biLogger` accepts an argument of type `HttpClient`, when obtaining dependencies directly from the graph, we don't provide dependencies ourselves as they are resolved by Obsidian.

## Advance usage
### Singleton graphs and providers
Graphs and Providers can be marked as singletons with the `@Singleton` decorator. When a graph is marked as a singleton, when an instance of that graph is requested, Obsidian will reuse the existing instance. Graphs that are not annotated with the `@Singleton` decorator will be instantiated each time they are needed for injection.

Singleton providers are shared between all instances of a graph.

```typescript
@Graph()
class PushedScreenGraph { // A new PushedScreenGraph instance is created each time the corresponding screen is created
  @Provides()
  presenter(): PushedScreenPresenter {
    return new PushedScreenPresenter(); // Created each time PushedGraph is created
  }

  @Provides() @Singleton()
  someUseCase(): SomeUseCase {
    return new SomeUseCase(); // Created once for all PushedGraph instances
  }
}
```

In this example we declared a singleton graph. This means that all of its providers are also singleton.
```typescript
@Singleton() @Graph()
class ApplicationGraph {
  @Provides()
  biLogger(): BiLogger {
    return new BiLogger() // Created once because the graph is a singleton
  }
}
```
### Graph middlewares
When working on large scale applications, a need to hook into various low level operations often arises. Obsidian lets you hook into the graph creation process by adding middlewares.

Middlewares are invoked in LIFO order and can be used for various purposes:
1. Create a graph yourself instead of letting Obsidian instantiate it.
2. Add logging to graph creation.
3. Handle errors when Obsidian instantiates graphs.
4. Replace graphs with mocks for testing purposes.

Middlewares follow the Chain of Responsibility pattern and therefor must always return a graph, either by creating one explicitly or by returning the instance created by another member in the resolve chain.

#### Adding a logging middleware
The following example demonstrates how to add a middleware that's used for logging purposes.

```typescript
const loggingMiddleware = new class extends GraphMiddleware {
      resolve<Props>(resolveChain: GraphResolveChain, Graph: Constructable<T>, props?: Props) {
        const t1 = Date.now();
        const graph = resolveChain.proceed(Graph, props);
        const t2 = Date.now();
        console.log(`Graph created in ${t2 - t1} milliseconds`);
        return graph;
      }
    }();
    Obsidian.addGraphMiddleware(loggingMiddleware);
```
## Prerequisites
Obsidian is highly opinionated and is developed with a specific environment in mind. Therefore, it has a few prerequisites for projects that want to integrate it.

### TypeScript
Obsidian targets TypeScript projects. There are no plans to officially support pure JS environments.

### Reflect-metadata
Install and enable the reflect-metadata polyfill.
* `npm install reflect-metadata`
* `import 'reflect-metadata';` - this needs to be done once, typically in your application's entry point (index.ts).

### Enable experimental decorators
Obsidian uses the Decorators feature whose proposal is still stage 2.

Add the following options to your `tsconfig.json` file.
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["reflect-metadata", "jest"],
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  }
}
```

### Babel
Obsidian relies on reflection to resolve dependencies. Production code is typically mangled to reduce bundle size. This means that some names Obsidian expects are changed during the mangling process. To workaround this, Obsidian persists the names of methods annotated with the `@Provides` decorator with a Babel transformer.

### Add Obsidian's babel transformer
Add the transformer to the list of plugins in your `.babel` file.
```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    ['@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators', {legacy: true}],
    react-obsidian/dist/transformers/babel-plugin-obsidian-provide
  ],
};
```

### Jest
react-obsidian publishes untranspiled code. If you're using Jest, you'll need to add react-obsidian to [transformIgnorePatterns](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transformignorepatterns-arraystring) so it's transpiled before tests are executed.
