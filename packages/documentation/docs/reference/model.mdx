## Reference
### use()
The `use` method is used to observe the properties of a model. It's intended to be used only in hooks.
#### Returns
An object containing all of the model's observable properties.

## Usage
### Observing properties
Since `Model` is an abstract class, you'll need to extend it to use it. Let's say you have an app state that looks like this:
```ts
class AppState {
  public user = new Observable<User>();
  public isLoggedIn = new Observable<boolean>();
}
```

You can use `Model` to observe the properties of `AppState` like this:

```ts
import { injectHook, Model } from 'react-obsidian';

// 1. Make AppState extend Model
class AppState extends Model {
  public user = new Observable<User>(); // { firstName: string; lastName: string;}
  public isLoggedIn = new Observable<boolean>();
}

// 2. `appState` is injected into the hook
const _useUserName = (appState: AppState) => {
  // 3. Use `appState.use()` to observe the properties
  const {user, isLoggedIn} = user.use();

  return `${user.firstName} is ${isLoggedIn ? '' : 'not '}logged in`;
};

export const useUserName = injectHook(_useUserName, /* SomeGraph */);
```
