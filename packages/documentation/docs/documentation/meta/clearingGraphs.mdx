title: "Clearing graphs"
---

Graphs can be cleared by invoking the `Obsidian.clearGraphs()` function. This is useful in tests or when you need to reset the system to it's original state, for example after a user logs out.

#### Clearing graphs automatically during execution of Jest tests
Create a `jest.setup.js` file and add it to [setupFilesAfterEnv](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#setupfilesafterenv-array). Then, import the following file when ensures graphs are cleared before each test.

```js
import 'react-obsidian/clearGraphs';
```
