The `eslint-plugin-obsidian` package provides ESLint rules for Obsidian. These rules help you catch common mistakes and enforce best practices when using Obsidian.

## Installation
#### Step 1: Install the plugin
```bash
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-obsidian
```
#### Step 2: Add the plugin to your ESLint configuration
```json
{
  "plugins": ["obsidian"],
  "rules": {
    "obsidian/unresolved-provider-dependencies": "error",
    "obsidian/no-circular-dependencies": "error",
    "obsidian/strongly-typed-inject-component": "error"
  }
}
```

## Rules
### unresolved-provider-dependencies
Ensure dependencies requested by providers can be resolved.

When a provider requests a dependency that is not provided by the graph or its subgraphs, this rule will trigger a lint error.

```ts
@graph()
class SomeGraph extends ObjectGraph {
  @Provides()
  someService(someDependency: SomeDependency) {
    //        ^ Since SomeDependency is not provided by the graph, this will trigger a lint error.
    return new SomeService(someDependency);
  }
}
```

### no-circular-dependencies
Prevent circular dependencies between providers.

When two providers depend on each other, this rule will trigger a lint error.

```ts
@graph()
class SomeGraph extends ObjectGraph {
  @Provides()
  foo(bar: Bar) {
    return new Foo(bar);
  }

  @Provides()
  bar(foo: Foo) {
    // ^ Since Foo depends on Bar, this will trigger a lint error.
    return new Bar(foo);
  }
}
```

### strongly-typed-inject-component
Ensure injected components are strongly typed.

When a component is injected using `injectComponent`, its props are typed with a combination of its `Own` props and the `Injected` props; `Own`, `Injected`, or `Own & Injected`. By default, `injectComponent` returns a component who's props are optional. This is correct if a component only depends on injected props. If a component also has its own props, then `Own` props should be required. This rule ensures that the `injectComponent` call is typed correctly.
