## Installation
#### Step 1: Install the plugin
```bash
yarn add -D eslint-plugin-obsidian
```
#### Step 2: Add the plugin to your ESLint configuration
```json
{
  "plugins": ["obsidian"],
  "rules": {
    "obsidian/unresolved-provider-dependencies": "error"
  }
}
```

## Rules
### unresolved-provider-dependencies
Ensure dependencies requested by providers can be resolved.

When a provider requests a dependency that is not provided by the graph or its subgraphs, this rule will trigger a lint error.

```ts
@Graph()
class SomeGraph extends ObjectGraph {
  @Provides()
  someService(someDependency: SomeDependency) {
    //        ^ Since SomeDependency is not provided by the graph, this will trigger a lint error.
    return new SomeService(someDependency);
  }
}
```
