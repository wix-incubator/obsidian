## Injecting classes
Injecting classes is a two step process. First, annotate the class with the `@injectable` annotation and pass the graph from which dependencies should be resolve. Then, declare the dependencies as class members and annotate them with the `@inject` annotation.

```ts
import {injectable, inject} from 'react-obsidian';
import {ApplicationGraph} from './ApplicationGraph';

@injectable(ApplicationGraph)
export class MyClass {
  @inject() private httpClient!: HttpClient;
  
}
```

:::important Always prefer constructor injection over field injection
Constructor injection is the preferred way to inject dependencies. It is more explicit and easier to test. **Field injection should only be used when a class is not instantiated by a graph.**
:::

## Delayed injection
Dependencies annotated with the `@inject` annotation are resolved immediately **after** the constructor is called. If you want to inject a class at a later point in time, you can use the `@lateInject` annotation instead, and inject the dependencies by manually with the `Obsidian.inject()` function.

```ts
import {injectable, lateInject} from 'react-obsidian';
import {ApplicationGraph} from './ApplicationGraph';

@injectable(ApplicationGraph)
export class MyClass {
  @lateInject() private httpClient!: HttpClient;

  public init() {
    console.log(this.httpClient === undefined); // true
    Obsidian.inject(this);
    console.log(this.httpClient === undefined); // false
  }
}
```
