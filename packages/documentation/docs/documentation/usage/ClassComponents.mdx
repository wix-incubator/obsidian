## Injecting class components
Injecting class components is a two step process. First, annotate the class with the `@injectable` annotation and pass the graph from which dependencies should be resolve. Then, declare the dependencies as class members and annotate them with the `@inject` annotation.

```ts
import {Injectable, Inject} from 'react-obsidian';
import {ApplicationGraph} from './ApplicationGraph';

@injectable(ApplicationGraph)
export class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  @inject() private httpClient!: HttpClient;
  
}
```
