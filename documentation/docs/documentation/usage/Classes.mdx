## Injecting classes
Injecting classes is a two step process. First, annotate the class with the `@Injectable` annotation and pass the graph from which dependencies should be resolve. Then, declare the dependencies as class members and annotate them with the `@Inject` annotation.

```ts
import {Injectable, Inject} from 'react-obsidian';
import {ApplicationGraph} from './ApplicationGraph';

@Injectable(ApplicationGraph)
export class MyClass {
  @Inject() private httpClient!: HttpClient;
  
}
```

:::important Always prefer constructor injection over field injection
Constructor injection is the preferred way to inject dependencies. It is more explicit and easier to test. **Field injection should only be used when a class is not instantiated by a graph.**
:::

## Delayed injection
Dependencies annotated with the `@Inject` annotation are resolved immediately **after** the constructor is called. Obsidian supports two methods to delay injection: `@LazyInject` and `@LateInject`.

### @LazyInject
Class fields annotated with the `@LazyInject` annotation are resolved lazily when they are accessed for the first time.

```ts
import {Injectable, LazyInject} from 'react-obsidian';
import {ApplicationGraph} from './ApplicationGraph';

@Injectable(ApplicationGraph)
export class MyClass {
  @LazyInject() private httpClient!: HttpClient;
  
  public init() {
    // HttpClient is hasn't been used yet, so it's undefined

    this.httpClient.get('https://www.wix.com'); // HttpClient is resolved once it's accessed
  }
}
```

### @LateInject
Use the `@LateInject` annotation to delay the injection of dependencies until a later point in time determined by the user.

```ts
import {Injectable, LateInject} from 'react-obsidian';
import {ApplicationGraph} from './ApplicationGraph';

@Injectable(ApplicationGraph)
export class MyClass {
  @LateInject() private httpClient!: HttpClient;

  public init() {
    console.log(this.httpClient === undefined); // true
    Obsidian.inject(this);
    console.log(this.httpClient === undefined); // false
  }
}
```
