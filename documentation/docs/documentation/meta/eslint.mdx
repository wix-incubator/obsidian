## @obsidian/unresolved-dependencies
Ensure dependencies requested by providers can be resolved.

When a provider requests a dependency that is not provided by the graph or its subgraphs, this rule will trigger a lint error.

```ts
@Graph()
class SomeGraph extends ObjectGraph {
  @Provides()
  someService(someDependency: SomeDependency) {
    //        ^ Since SomeDependency is not provided by the graph, this will trigger a lint error.
    return new SomeService(someDependency);
  }
}
```
