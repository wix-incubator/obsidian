`mockModel` **is a utility function that allows you to easily mock [models](/docs/reference/model).**

* [Reference](#reference)
  * [mockModel(modelToMock)](#mockmodelmodeltomock-partialmodel-model)

## Reference
### `mockModel(mock, BaseClass?): Model`
Mock a given model, and return a new instance with the specified properties stubbed.
#### Parameters
• `mock`: The partial implementation of the model to mock. Only the specified Observable properties will be stubbed. The rest will be left undefined. <br/>
• `BaseClass?`: An optional base class to use for the mock. This is useful in cases where your model has helper methods or getters that should be included in the mock. 
#### Returns
• A new instance of the model with the specified properties stubbed.

## Usage
### Stubbing Observable Properties
The `mockModel` function allows you to easily stub out Observable properties in a model. Consider the following example:

```ts
class AppState {
  public session = new Observable<string | undefined>();
  public isLoggedIn = new MediatorObservable(false).mapSource(session => !!session);
}
```

The `isLoggedIn` property is a [MediatorObservable](/docs/reference/mediatorObservable) that maps the value of the `session` property to a boolean. When using this model in a test, we don't want to be bothered with the implementation details of the `isLoggedIn` property. We can easily stub out the `isLoggedIn` while ignoring the `session` property by using the `mockModel` function.

```ts
import { mockModel } from 'react-obsidian';

describe('AppState', () => {
  it('should return true if the user is logged in', () => {
    const mockAppState = mockModel({
      isLoggedIn: new Observable(true)
    });

    expect(mockAppState.isLoggedIn.value).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Including class methods and getters
We encourage developers to add helper methods and getters to their models. This is a great way to encapsulate business logic in the domain layer. In order to include these methods in your mocks you can provide a base class to the `mockModel` function.

Consider the following example. The `AppState` model has a getter called `isLoggedIn` that returns a boolean based on the value of the `session` property.

```ts
import { injectHook, Model } from 'react-obsidian';

class AppState extends Model {
  public user = new Observable<User>(); // { firstName: string; lastName: string;}
  public session = new Observable<string>();

  get isLoggedIn(): boolean {
    return !!this.loggedIn.value;
  }
}
```

In order to include the `isLoggedIn` getter in the mock, we can provide the `AppState` class as the second argument to `mockModel`.

```ts
import { mockModel } from 'react-obsidian';

describe('AppState', () => {
  it('should return true if the user is logged in', () => {
    const mockAppState = mockModel({
        session: new Observable('1234')
      },
      AppState // When a base class is provided, the mock will be an instance of that class.
    );

    expect(mockAppState.isLoggedIn).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
