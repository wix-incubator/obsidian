`MediatorObservable` **is a type of** `Observable` **that acts as an adapter between one or more source** `Observable`**s. It allows us to create a new observable stream based on the values of other observables.**

For example, we can create a `MediatorObservable` that observes an Observable of a certain type and emits a new value based on the value of the source observable.

```ts
const user = new Observable<User>();

const isLoggedIn = new MediatorObservable<boolean>();
isLoggedIn.add(user, (nextUser) => isLoggedIn.value = nextUser !== undefined);
```

## Reference
### new MediatorObservable(initialValue?)
Creates a new `MediatorObservable` with an optional initial value.
#### Arguments
* `initialValue?` - The initial value of the `MediatorObservable`. Defaults to `undefined`.

#### Caveats
* It's possible to instantiate a `MediatorObservable` without an initial value, but it's not recommended, as its value will be `undefined` until it's set for the first time which can lead to unexpected behavior.
___

### addSource(source, onNext): this
Starts observing the given source and calls the `onNext` callback when the source emits a new value.

#### Arguments
* `source` - The source `Observable` to observe.
* `onNext` - The callback to be called when the source emits a new value. The `onNext` callback receives the new value of the source as an argument. __In order to update the value of the `MediatorObservable`, call the [value setter](observable#set-value) with the new value__.

#### Returns
`addSource` returns the `MediatorObservable` instance, so it can be chained with other methods.
___

### mapSource(source, mapNext): this
Starts observing the given source and calls the `onNext` callback when the source emits a new value.

#### Arguments
* `source` - The source `Observable` to observe.
* `mapNext` - The callback to be called when the source emits a new value. The `mapNext` callback receives the new value of the source as an argument and __must return the new value of the `MediatorObservable`__.

#### Returns
`mapSource` returns the `MediatorObservable` instance, so it can be chained with other methods.

---
### addSources(sources, onNext): this
Similar to [addSource](#addsourcesource-onnext-this), but accepts an array of sources instead of a single source. Use this method when the logic of the `onNext` callback is the same for all sources.

#### Arguments
* `sources` - An array of source `Observable`s to observe.
* `onNext` - The callback to be called when any of the sources emits a new value. The `onNext` callback receives the current values of all sources as arguments. In order to update the value of the `MediatorObservable`, call the [value setter](observable#set-value) with the new value.

#### Returns
`addSources` returns the `MediatorObservable` instance, so it can be chained with other methods.

---
### mapSources(sources, mapNext): this
Similar to [mapSource](#mapsourcesource-mapnext-this), but accepts an array of sources instead of a single source. Use this method when the logic of the `mapNext` callback is the same for all sources.

#### Arguments
* `sources` - An array of source `Observable`s to observe.
* `mapNext` - The callback to be called when any of the sources emits a new value. The `mapNext` callback receives the current values of all sources as arguments and should return the new value of the `MediatorObservable`.

#### Returns
`mapSources` returns the `MediatorObservable` instance, so it can be chained with other methods.

## Usage
### Observing multiple sources
Sometimes data is computed from the values of other observables. We can use `MediatorObservable` to create a new observable that observes other observables and emits a new value based on their values.

Let's walk through an example to see how this works. Say we're developing a live streaming app and want to change the quality of the stream based on the device's battery level and the network speed. We'll create two observables, `batteryLevel` and `networkSpeed`, and we'll merge their emissions in one new `MediatorObservable` called `streamQuality`. By doing so, `batteryLevel` and `networkSpeed` will become the sources of the new `MediatorObservable`. 

```ts
enum NetworkSpeed { Poor = 150, Moderate = 550, Good = 2000 }
enum streamQuality { Low, Medium, High }

const batteryLevel = new Observable<number>();
const networkSpeed = new Observable<number>();

// Every time one of the sources emits a new value, the mediator will call the callback function
const streamQuality = new MediatorObservable<streamQuality>().mapSources(
  [batteryLevel, networkSpeed],
  (batteryLevel, networkSpeed) => {
    if (batteryLevel < 15 || networkSpeed < NetworkSpeed.Poor) {
      return streamQuality.Low;
    }

    if (networkSpeed < NetworkSpeed.Moderate) {
      return StreamQuality.Medium;
    }

    return StreamQuality.High;
  }
);
```

Now, every time the battery level or the network speed changes, the `streamQuality` observable will emit a new value based on the new values of the sources.

### Conditional rendering of a component
When optimizing React applications for performance, avoiding unnecessary renders is one of the most important things to do. One way to do this is to use `Observable` to conditionally render a component only when a certain condition is met. We can use `MediatorObservable` to create a new observable that observes another and emits a value only when a condition is met.

To illustrate this, let's create a `MediatorObservable` that observes a user's score in a game. The `MediatorObservable` will emit a new value when the user's score is greater than 10. We'll use this observable to conditionally render a component that displays a message when the user wins the game.

First, we'll declare the observables that we'll use:
```tsx
// An observable that tracks a user's score in a game
const gameScoreObservable = new Observable<number>(0);

const isWinnerObservable = new MediatorObservable<boolean>(false)
  .addSource(gameScoreObservable, (score) => {
    if (score > 10) {
      gameState.value = true;
    }
  });
```

Now we can use the `isWinnerObservable` to conditionally render the game's status:
```tsx
const Game = () => {
  const [isWinner] = useObserver(isWinnerObservable);

  return (
    <div>
      {isWinner && <p>You won!</p>}
      <GameBoard />
    </div>
  )
}
