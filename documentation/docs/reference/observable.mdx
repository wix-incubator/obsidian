`Observable` **is a class that represents a stream of values. It is similar to** `Promise` **in that it is a container for a value that will be available in the future. However, unlike **`Promise`**, **`Observable`** can emit multiple values over time.**

```ts
const isLoggedIn = new Observable(false);
isLoggedIn.subscribe((nextValue: boolean) => {
  if (nextValue) {
    console.log('User is logged in');
  } else {
    console.log('User is logged out');
  }
});
```

### Reference
#### new Observable(initialValue?)
Creates a new `Observable` instance with an optional initial value.
#### Arguments
* `initialValue?` - The initial value of the `Observable`. Defaults to `undefined`.

#### Caveats
* It's possible to instantiate an `Observable` without an initial value, but it's not recommended, as its value will be `undefined` until it's set for the first time which can lead to unexpected behavior.
___
### subscribe(onNext)
The `subscribe` method is used to listen for changes to the `Observable`'s value. It returns a function that can be used to unsubscribe from the `Observable`.
#### Arguments
* `onNext` - A function that will be called whenever the `Observable`'s value changes. It receives the new value as an argument.
#### returns
* `unsubscribe` - A function that can be used to unsubscribe from the `Observable`.
___
### unsubscribe(onNext)
The `unsubscribe` method is used to unsubscribe from the `Observable` a specific `onNext` callback.
#### Arguments
* `onNext` - The `onNext` callback to unsubscribe.
___
### set value
The `value` property is used to set the `Observable`'s value. Changing the value will trigger all subscribers and will trigger a rerender if the `Observable` is used in a Component or a Hook.
___
### get value
The `value` property is used to get the `Observable`'s current value.
