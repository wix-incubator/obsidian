## Injecting hooks

Hooks are a fundamental construct in React. They allow you to plug into the lifecycle of a component or react to user interaction and execute code accordingly. As such, hooks typically need to interact with services where the actual logic is implemented.

Injecting hooks is simple and straightforward. Simply wrap your hook with the `injectHook` function and declare any required dependencies as destructured properties.

```tsx
import { injectHook, DependenciesOf } from 'react-obsidian';
import { ApplicationGraph } from './ApplicationGraph';

const myHook = ({fooService, barService}: Props) => {
  // do something with fooService and barService
}

type Props = DependenciesOf<ApplicationGraph, 'fooService' | 'barService'>; // {fooService: FooService, barService: BarService}

export injectHook(myHook, ApplicationGraph);
```

## Strongly typed hooks
Writing strongly typed hooks is important to ensure that your hooks are easy to use and that you don't accidentally break them when refactoring. 

### Combining injected dependencies and required arguments
Sometimes you want to inject hooks with dependencies, but also require additional arguments that will be passed from the calling scope. This is possible by using the `injectHookWithArguments` function.

```tsx
import { injectHook, DependenciesOf } from 'react-obsidian';
import { ApplicationGraph } from './ApplicationGraph';

type Injected = DependenciesOf<ApplicationGraph, 'fooService'>; // {fooService: FooService}
type Own = {count: number};

const myHook = ({fooService, count}: Injected & Own) => {
  // do something with fooService and count
}

export default injectHookWithArguments<Injected, Own>(myHook, ApplicationGraph);
```

When using `myHook`, we must pass the `count` argument otherwise we will get a type error. `fooService`, on the other hand, is optional and will be injected from the graph unless passed explicitly.

```tsx
import myHook from './myHook';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(1337);
  myHook({count}); 
  
}
```

### Typing the return value of a hook
When using the standard `injectHook` function, the return value of the hook is inferred automatically by TypeScript. However, when using `injectHookWithArguments`, due to limitations of TypeScript's Generics system, the return value is not inferred and you'll have to specify it explicity.

```ts
import { injectHook, DependenciesOf } from 'react-obsidian';
import { ApplicationGraph } from './ApplicationGraph';

type Injected = DependenciesOf<ApplicationGraph, 'fooService'>;
type Own = {count: number};
type Result: {onPress: () => void};

const myHook = ({fooService, count}: Injected & Own): Result => {
  const onPress = useCallback(() => {
    fooService.doSomething(count);
  }, [fooService, count]);
  return {onPress};
}

export default injectHookWithArguments<Injected, Own, Result>(myHook, ApplicationGraph);
```

Now the onPress callback is typed correctly when using the injected hook.
```tsx
import myHook from './myHook';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(1337);
  const {onPress} = myHook({count});
}
```
