## Injecting classes
Injecting classes is a two step process. First, annotate the class with the `@Injectable` annotation and pass the graph from which dependencies should be resolve. Then, declare the dependencies as class members and annotate them with the `@Inject` annotation.

```ts
import {Injectable, Inject} from 'react-obsidian';
import {ApplicationGraph} from './ApplicationGraph';

@Injectable(ApplicationGraph)
export class MyClass {
  @Inject() private httpClient!: HttpClient;
  
}
```

:::important Always prefer constructor injection over field injection
Constructor injection is the preferred way to inject dependencies. It is more explicit and easier to test. **Field injection should only be used when a class is not instantiated by a graph.**
:::

## Lazy injection
Dependencies annotated with the `@Inject` annotation are resolved immediately **after** the constructor is called. If you want to inject a class at a later point in time, you can use the `@LazyInject` annotation instead, and inject the dependencies by manually with the `Obsidian.inject()` function.

```ts
import {Injectable, LazyInject} from 'react-obsidian';
import {ApplicationGraph} from './ApplicationGraph';

@Injectable(ApplicationGraph)
export class MyClass {
  @LazyInject() private httpClient!: HttpClient;

  public init() {
    console.log(this.httpClient === undefined); // true
    Obsidian.inject(this);
    console.log(this.httpClient === undefined); // false
  }
}
```
