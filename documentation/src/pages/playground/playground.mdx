# Obsidian playground

The following is a live playground for Obsidian. You can fork the code to edit it or use it as a template for your own project.
It's adapted from the state management example in the [React docs](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) and is meant to demonstrate how Obsidian can be used to manage both state and dependencies in a React app.

export const Playground = ({children, color}) => (
  <iframe
    style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", borderRadius: "2px"}}
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    src="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/obsidian-task-list-c16w8r?file=/src/App.tsx:,C11&embed=1&hidenavigation=1"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>
);

<Playground />
